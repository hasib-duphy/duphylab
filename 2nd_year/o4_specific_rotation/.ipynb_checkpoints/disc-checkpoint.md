# Specific rotation
- Analyzer is mechanically attached to angle scale. So, there is no backlash in the setup.
- Waiting and adjusting eyes to low light before each reading enhances precision, since the eyes become more light sensitive by adjusting to the ambient environment.
-   Air Bubble centering to prevent blockage by other than air
- When dark region goes close to full dark, it becomes useful to observe the peak in the bright region
-   half shade polarimeter gives two beams with (nearly) perpemdicular polarization. It is not necessary that the instrument have perfect alignment, that is, produce beams with perfecty normal polarization. Whenever the analyzer's polarization plane bisects the angle between the two beams, the shades of the two semi circles become equal, givimg us a quite precise reference.
-   Light goes through diffuser first. diffuser helps remove optical non-uniformities
-   You can focus on your own accord by adjusting eyepiece
-   It appeared that taking the left side fully dark gave the best definifion, after focusing the eyepiece. Making the shades equal was impractical because of dirt on the right semicircle. If the setup had been cleaner, then matching shades might have been a better option
-   focus goes offset whenever we change the concentration of sugar solution. It's yet unknown as to why it happened.
-   due to not proper mixing, the solultion is nonhomogenic
-   Layer stratefication
-   Eye sensitivity can't detect a range of low intensity, contrasting is not useful enough.
-   Four data points for 10 g/100ml and lesser concentrations consistently deviate from the best fit line. That indicates a systematic error in the dilution step from 20g/100mL to 10g/100mL. This is possible because the first dilution step had not been mixed very throughly.
