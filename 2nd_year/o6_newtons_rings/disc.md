### Newton's Rings via Sodium vapour lamp  

1) Light adjustment first for maximum brightness. (While this, focus is irrelevant. The angle should be adjusted to do so.
2) Find specs of dust by focus after that.
3) Then move the plane for adjusting and Newton's Rings will be easily visible through translation such that travelling microscope is focused to align with centre where the convex side of planoconvex lens is touching the plane
4) Planoconvex lens is collimating diverging rays from source.
5) The readings are not precise, the line cuts in vernier scale is about 0.01 mm and this is also the LC = 0.01 mm so taking reading is very hard
6) Greater magnification factor is needed.
7)
