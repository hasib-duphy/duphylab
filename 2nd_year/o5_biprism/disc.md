### Discussion

1) This setup uses sodium lamp - single slit (varying width) - biprism - eyepiece
2) There are 3 moving stands in total
3) two virtual sources (slits) are created through single slit by using biprism.
4) the wavefront is cylindrical probably.
5) the screw in single slit is loose, so the slit rotates without anything being done, screw slips.
6) the santed side is directed towards the sodium lamp
7) The vertical angular alignment of biprism and single slit is sensitive, slight angle variation causes the interference pattern to be invisible and it's visible in very small range. If both are aligned but are not vertically aligned enough, our measured distances will have systematic error, we will be measuring
distance = width * secant of angle with vertical ; instead of the width itself.
9) fringe width will be nonlinear the closer we go to biprism with eyepiece
10) sodium lamp, single slit, biprism are conjusted almost together one after another with almost no space
11) if the translational (left right) alignment is not perfect, the further we go with eyepiece, the pattern diverges. the rate of divergence depends on how deviated the vertical alignment is.
12) eyepiece is used for magnification of interference fringes.
13) The closer the biprism is to the single slit, the smaller double slit distance is, fringe gap increases, measurement becomes easy, thus they should be put together as close as possible.
14) Every stand here moves by the slightest of touch and it causes problems for taking measurements. It moves voluntarily by few fringes like this.
there are necessary screws that are missing which is the main cause for this mechanica lissue.
15) Spirit lamp is used to align to compensate for the non vertical eyepiece (crosswire is not vertical)
vertical is needed or the measurements will be off by sec/cos factor.
16) Single slit and biprisms are aligned based on this alignment.
17) Eyepiece can rotate which can cause error to happen in measurement (tangential displacement)
18) One should not touch any part that aligns, it can misalign easily, very sensitive and prone to errors.
